The inside looks like a fire hall set up for a wedding.   It is so loud that I sometimes can't hear my dinner partner across the table.  But none of that matters when you taste the food.  The pasta is outstanding, and served in enormous, enormous portions.  The menu is a bit cryptic - dishes aren't really described, only named, so make sure you know what you're getting before you order.  \n",

She explained the specials and talked to my husband about their Cruisin' nights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>2017-09-08 23:39:53</td></tr>\n",

It was delicious!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>2013-08-03 17:47:13</td></tr>\n",

One nice perk is that they have an open table that you can stand at to enjoy your pre-dinner drinks so you don't have to crowd around those sitting at the bar. I absolutely love the atmosphere at this place with the big wood-burning pizza oven behind the bar where you can watch your pizza being cooked. They have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big. When I went a couple months ago, they had caramelized brussel sprouts that they cooked in the wood-burning oven that were amazing!! I've tried many of their pizzas and haven't had one that I dislike. My favorites are the Quattro Formaggio and the Spicy Sopressata, which despite the name, is not too spicy. In the summer, a huge perk to this place is their outdoor patio. They have a couple long picnic tables and also have smaller tables along the fence. On a warm spring/summer night, it's very relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>2014-01-17 16:49:06</td></tr>\n",

We will be back again for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>2014-08-11 02:06:40</td></tr>\n",

The entrance was a little confusing, but we quickly realized that we were walking through the brewery which was super cool. Our waitress was super friendly. I got the chipotle bbq chicken sandwich and the bbq pork sandwich. Both were delicious and good sized portions for the price and those fries! The menu said they were homemade beer battered fries and they were amazing! I also got one of their house brewed beers on tap which was also good and the pricing is more than reasonable on a pint! I was extremely pleased with our entire experience and we will be going back often!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>2015-03-04 20:18:07</td></tr>\n",

I was visiting extended family and we bought two pizzas--1/2 veggie/meat and one cheese. The sauce was too sweet and the veggies were not at all what I expected.

They also have burgers for $2.49!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>2013-12-07 01:19:24</td></tr>\n",

I wish my girlfriend still lived down the street from this place because we don't get there as often as we should.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>2015-06-08 18:51:54</td></tr>\n",

I didn't have a lot of options but the front desk suggested this place. I got the shrimp sandwich &amp; jalapeño poppers for delivery. The food took a while &amp; when I called the restaurant, the workers sounded baffled bc my order had been lost. It wasn't until the manager (Matt, I believe) came on the line to help me out. I guess the driver had gotten lost &amp; went to the wrong hotel. In the middle of my meal, I realized I didn't get a receipt so I called back &amp; the manager was willing to drop it off on his way home. I thought that was really sweet but I insisted he drop it off tomorrow. I still woke up to my receipt &amp; I must say, I was really impressed by him. The fact that I'm from out of town clearly means I won't be a regular here, so he didn't have to go out of his way. It was unfortunate my food was late but unlike the servers who answered the phone &amp; casually just said my order wasn't placed, then handed the phone to the manager because they didn't want to deal with me, the manager going out of his way to make sure I was happy really stood out to me. Also, the food really IS delicious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </span></td><td>2014-10-27 12:17:36</td></tr>\n",

       "Let me start by saying we came in during the dinner rush on a Saturday and were able to immediately sit at the bar area. While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. \n",

       "As far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service.\n",

       "My dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. \n",

       "We ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.  The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin.

Ordered the chicken Marsala. Meal came with angel hair pasta. Chicken was good but they forgot to include the Marsala sauce. You have to make sure there is enough sauce to go on the pasta. Pasta was so dry it was hard to eat. You need to make this meal a lot better. Other than that the service was very good and wait staff very friendly. Have had other meals which were good but this was really not up to par.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>2019-12-07 15:04:13</td></tr>\n",

I ordered the special vegan lasagna. It was very good but a little small. What I don't understand is why a small lasagna cost $19. I found that to be an outrageous price. I only ordered it because it was different. I could have easily been priced at $10 or even less. Tomatoes and even vegan cheese are not that expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td><td>2019-11-19 07:24:12</td></tr>\n",

But if you are a noon-riser, bougee bruncher, this is your place!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td><td>2019-12-05 22:59:39</td></tr>\n",

There were 8 of us so we got to try everything. 95% of what we tried was very good, 5% not at all. Everything there is made from scratch, you can see the kitchen out in the open and you can taste that in the quality of the food. Crispy Brussels Sprouts - good, Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Carpaccio - excellent, Grilled Peach and Mascarpone Dip - the only hiccup of the night, not good at all, Sweet Corn and White Bean Chowder Soup - good. For main courses: 4 cheese bianco - I am not a good judge of pizza as I don't eat it but my niece said it was good, my son had a burger - he said it was excellent, very big portion, fried chicken - this portion is absolutely huge and my brother devoured it, he said it was excellent (I didn't try it personally), barramundi (from their specials menu) - very good, walleye - excellent, grilled prime sirloin - excellent, definitely a great value at $23. For dessert - their house made donuts holes and flourless chocolate torte - both excellent. At the end of the night, the owner (Israel) stopped by our table, asked us for the feedback, when we mentioned our experience with the dip (see above), they promptly removed it from the bill. Our server (and I apologize I don't remember the name) - was excellent, very friendly and attentive. So why 4 stars and not 5? The noise level was very loud (we came on Friday night), at some points we didn't hear each other and since restaurant was very busy our server was trying to be in too many places at the same time. But, great experience overall, great value for the money and my daughter even mentioned that she will consider this restaurant for her birthday with her friends (they have semi-private room in the back that wouldn't be as loud so could work out perfectly)</td><td>2019-12-07 19:57:20</td></tr>\n",

       "Honestly, this is my new favorite brunch spot. The have plenty of food choices and the service is great. I ordered the salmon omelet which was cooked to perfection.

We called back the store and the dude came back. He told me and my brother ( me being 14 and him being 12) that we miscounted it and that he was really good at math we couldn't be wrong but he said if he has extra money at the end of his shift he would drop it off to us. I thought that was weird and told my mom who like a mom does freaked out that her money was basically stolen. Note we're broke broke. So she calls corporate just in case I have no clue what she said to them. After that we got our money back and everything was fine and dandy just a simple screw up. \n",

The owner needs a Xanax or something. I went there because I have allergies and it  was close by.  After waiting for several minutes for someone to help me, I asked if I could get a gluten-free cheese steak hoagie with the vegan cheese. He said no, they only have a gluten free menu or a allergen free menu. I said ok, and ordered something very quickly from the allergen free page because I could tell he was annoyed and stressed out. So then I order a normal pizza for my daughter, he tells me the total, and I pull out a credit card. He says we don't accept credit cards, I said oh ok. Eh I don't think I have cash on me as I search my wallet. I only had four dollars so I said. Oh I guess we'll have to go somewhere else. He FLIPS on me, tells me that I'M RUDE and continues to yell obscenities at me and my little daughter. My daughter starts crying, and I tell the guy to shut up and he seriously YELLED At me saying \"OH wow, what a great mom you are.\" And I said \"Thank you, I AM a great mom.\" left. Never in my life has any business owner been like that. Especially one who claims to care about allergies. So I tell my brother who used to order form there frequently (we were visiting him) and he said they don't order from there anymore because its gone downhill and they've screwed up my SIL's order so many times. It may have been good at one time but I neither me or my family will ever support them again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td><td>2019-11-14 19:10:18</td></tr>\n",

We stood at the podium and waited for the hostess to seat us.... and waited..... and waited....   it was a good ten minutes before the hostess appeared (with no apology) and seated us in back when there were plenty of tables by a window--not a big deal though.    And we waited.... and waited....  after fifteen minutes of being ignored by several servers going to other tables, my wife got up and reminded the hostess of our existence and that we had not seen a server at our table.  Another five to seven minutes of waiting and we got up and left.  On our way out, we mentioned that we were leaving to a server who acted like we had told an extremely funny joke.  Never again, La Brioche.  You have lost our business forever!\n",
       "  BTW, we went to Cafe Hollander in Hilldale where we were seated and waited upon immediately.  The food was outstanding too.  I strongly recommend Cafe Hollander over La Brioche!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td><td>2017-06-13 02:14:53</td></tr>\n",

Unfortunately I was disappointed. Our waitress seemed disconnected, was not friendly and seemed like she didn't want to be there, so that was not a good start. We started with the lump crab appetizer which was good. They don't give you enough tortillas to dip, so I asked for a couple more and saw a charge on my bill for that. The place is loud, so be prepared. I had the shrimp and lobster fettuccine which was ok, a little bland, and the Lake House salad, which was good, original. Unfortunately I didn't see anything interesting on the cocktail menu so I had water. My bill for the 3 items came to $48, which I thought was a bit high for what I got. There are other places I would rather go if I'm going to spend $50 for a meal. I look forward to going back to Lindys in Columbus again but the Lake House, probably not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>2019-11-16 14:37:10</td></tr>\n",

Will not be back to this one                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             & 2018-05-02 18:55:11\\\\\n",

The inside looks like a fire hall set up for a wedding.   It is so loud that I sometimes can't hear my dinner partner across the table.  But none of that matters when you taste the food.  The pasta is outstanding, and served in enormous, enormous portions.  The menu is a bit cryptic - dishes aren't really described, only named, so make sure you know what you're getting before you order.  \n",

My husband enjoyed his pizza, but Angelos in Lakewood is still his favorite. The lady at the counter who took our order was very friendly and helpful. She explained the specials and talked to my husband about their Cruisin' nights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & 2017-09-08 23:39:53\\\\\n",

It was delicious!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 2013-08-03 17:47:13\\\\\n",

One nice perk is that they have an open table that you can stand at to enjoy your pre-dinner drinks so you don't have to crowd around those sitting at the bar. I absolutely love the atmosphere at this place with the big wood-burning pizza oven behind the bar where you can watch your pizza being cooked. They have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big. When I went a couple months ago, they had caramelized brussel sprouts that they cooked in the wood-burning oven that were amazing!! I've tried many of their pizzas and haven't had one that I dislike. My favorites are the Quattro Formaggio and the Spicy Sopressata, which despite the name, is not too spicy. In the summer, a huge perk to this place is their outdoor patio. They have a couple long picnic tables and also have smaller tables along the fence. On a warm spring/summer night, it's very relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 2014-01-17 16:49:06\\\\\n",

What a great choice we made.  Sat at the bar up front and enjoyed the interaction with both the bartenders and cooks who prepare the food right in front of you.  Had the grilled oysters as appitizer (awesome must have) along with the halibut special which was off the charts. We will be back again for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & 2014-08-11 02:06:40\\\\\n",

The entrance was a little confusing, but we quickly realized that we were walking through the brewery which was super cool. Our waitress was super friendly. I got the chipotle bbq chicken sandwich and the bbq pork sandwich. Both were delicious and good sized portions for the price and those fries! The menu said they were homemade beer battered fries and they were amazing! I also got one of their house brewed beers on tap which was also good and the pricing is more than reasonable on a pint! I was extremely pleased with our entire experience and we will be going back often!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 2015-03-04 20:18:07\\\\\n",

I was visiting extended family and we bought two pizzas--1/2 veggie/meat and one cheese. The sauce was too sweet and the veggies were not at all what I expected. Now, Mineo's...better pizza.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & 2009-03-01 03:53:38\\\\\n",

They also have burgers for \\$2.49!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & 2013-12-07 01:19:24\\\\\n",

Work on your customer service and don't offer things that you're not willing to provide                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & 2016-01-04 07:33:29\\\\\n",

I wish my girlfriend still lived down the street from this place because we don't get there as often as we should.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 2015-06-08 18:51:54\\\\\n",

I didn't have a lot of options but the front desk suggested this place. I got the shrimp sandwich \\& jalapeño poppers for delivery. The food took a while \\& when I called the restaurant, the workers sounded baffled bc my order had been lost. It wasn't until the manager (Matt, I believe) came on the line to help me out. I guess the driver had gotten lost \\& went to the wrong hotel. In the middle of my meal, I realized I didn't get a receipt so I called back \\& the manager was willing to drop it off on his way home. I thought that was really sweet but I insisted he drop it off tomorrow. I still woke up to my receipt \\& I must say, I was really impressed by him. The fact that I'm from out of town clearly means I won't be a regular here, so he didn't have to go out of his way. It was unfortunate my food was late but unlike the servers who answered the phone \\& casually just said my order wasn't placed, then handed the phone to the manager because they didn't want to deal with me, the manager going out of his way to make sure I was happy really stood out to me. Also, the food really IS delicious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & 2014-10-27 12:17:36\\\\\n",

       "Let me start by saying we came in during the dinner rush on a Saturday and were able to immediately sit at the bar area. While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. \n",

       "As far as service goes, I left over a 20\\% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service.\n",

       "My dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. \n",

       "We ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.  The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin. The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. \n",

Chicken was good but they forgot to include the Marsala sauce. You have to make sure there is enough sauce to go on the pasta. Pasta was so dry it was hard to eat. You need to make this meal a lot better. Other than that the service was very good and wait staff very friendly. Have had other meals which were good but this was really not up to par.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & 2019-12-07 15:04:13\\\\\n",

It was very good but a little small. What I don't understand is why a small lasagna cost \\$19. I found that to be an outrageous price. I only ordered it because it was different. I could have easily been priced at \\$10 or even less. Tomatoes and even vegan cheese are not that expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & 2019-11-19 07:24:12\\\\\n",

But if you are a noon-riser, bougee bruncher, this is your place!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & 2019-12-05 22:59:39\\\\\n",

There were 8 of us so we got to try everything. 95\\% of what we tried was very good, 5\\% not at all. Everything there is made from scratch, you can see the kitchen out in the open and you can taste that in the quality of the food. Crispy Brussels Sprouts - good, Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Carpaccio - excellent, Grilled Peach and Mascarpone Dip - the only hiccup of the night, not good at all, Sweet Corn and White Bean Chowder Soup - good. For main courses: 4 cheese bianco - I am not a good judge of pizza as I don't eat it but my niece said it was good, my son had a burger - he said it was excellent, very big portion, fried chicken - this portion is absolutely huge and my brother devoured it, he said it was excellent (I didn't try it personally), barramundi (from their specials menu) - very good, walleye - excellent, grilled prime sirloin - excellent, definitely a great value at \\$23. For dessert - their house made donuts holes and flourless chocolate torte - both excellent. At the end of the night, the owner (Israel) stopped by our table, asked us for the feedback, when we mentioned our experience with the dip (see above), they promptly removed it from the bill. Our server (and I apologize I don't remember the name) - was excellent, very friendly and attentive. So why 4 stars and not 5? The noise level was very loud (we came on Friday night), at some points we didn't hear each other and since restaurant was very busy our server was trying to be in too many places at the same time. But, great experience overall, great value for the money and my daughter even mentioned that she will consider this restaurant for her birthday with her friends (they have semi-private room in the back that wouldn't be as loud so could work out perfectly) & 2019-12-07 19:57:20\\\\\n",

They have a piano player during the weekends which adds an extra touch of elegance. \n",

       "Honestly, this is my new favorite brunch spot. The have plenty of food choices and the service is great. I ordered the salmon omelet which was cooked to perfection.

S/o to those two, I will definitely be returning!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & 2018-06-29 03:06:51\\\\\n",

Some of the servers there are just not super personable (although some are fantastic). The bartenders tend to be slow. The hosts are usually just kind of meh. But we love the food so much! And the hot olive Bloody Mary is five stars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 2019-09-13 17:23:46\\\\\n",

We called back the store and the dude came back. He told me and my brother ( me being 14 and him being 12) that we miscounted it and that he was really good at math we couldn't be wrong but he said if he has extra money at the end of his shift he would drop it off to us. I thought that was weird and told my mom who like a mom does freaked out that her money was basically stolen. Note we're broke broke. So she calls corporate just in case I have no clue what she said to them. After that we got our money back and everything was fine and dandy just a simple screw up. \n",

Meanwhile I look around and there are less than 10 patrons in the restaurant that seats close to 100 for dining. So I walk away and go somewhere else.

The owner needs a Xanax or something. I went there because I have allergies and it  was close by.  After waiting for several minutes for someone to help me, I asked if I could get a gluten-free cheese steak hoagie with the vegan cheese. He said no, they only have a gluten free menu or a allergen free menu. I said ok, and ordered something very quickly from the allergen free page because I could tell he was annoyed and stressed out. So then I order a normal pizza for my daughter, he tells me the total, and I pull out a credit card. He says we don't accept credit cards, I said oh ok. Eh I don't think I have cash on me as I search my wallet. I only had four dollars so I said. Oh I guess we'll have to go somewhere else. He FLIPS on me, tells me that I'M RUDE and continues to yell obscenities at me and my little daughter. My daughter starts crying, and I tell the guy to shut up and he seriously YELLED At me saying \"OH wow, what a great mom you are.\" And I said \"Thank you, I AM a great mom.\" left. Never in my life has any business owner been like that. Especially one who claims to care about allergies. So I tell my brother who used to order form there frequently (we were visiting him) and he said they don't order from there anymore because its gone downhill and they've screwed up my SIL's order so many times. It may have been good at one time but I neither me or my family will ever support them again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             & 2019-11-14 19:10:18\\\\\n",

The food is nearly always excellent, but the service is uneven.  We went in for Sunday brunch and found the restaurant maybe half-full.  We stood at the podium and waited for the hostess to seat us.... and waited..... and waited....   it was a good ten minutes before the hostess appeared (with no apology) and seated us in back when there were plenty of tables by a window--not a big deal though.    And we waited.... and waited....  after fifteen minutes of being ignored by several servers going to other tables, my wife got up and reminded the hostess of our existence and that we had not seen a server at our table.  Another five to seven minutes of waiting and we got up and left.  On our way out, we mentioned that we were leaving to a server who acted like we had told an extremely funny joke.  Never again, La Brioche.  You have lost our business forever!\n",
       "  BTW, we went to Cafe Hollander in Hilldale where we were seated and waited upon immediately.  The food was outstanding too.  I strongly recommend Cafe Hollander over La Brioche!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & 2017-06-13 02:14:53\\\\\n",

Unfortunately I was disappointed. Our waitress seemed disconnected, was not friendly and seemed like she didn't want to be there, so that was not a good start. We started with the lump crab appetizer which was good. They don't give you enough tortillas to dip, so I asked for a couple more and saw a charge on my bill for that. The place is loud, so be prepared. I had the shrimp and lobster fettuccine which was ok, a little bland, and the Lake House salad, which was good, original. Unfortunately I didn't see anything interesting on the cocktail menu so I had water. My bill for the 3 items came to \\$48, which I thought was a bit high for what I got. There are other places I would rather go if I'm going to spend \\$50 for a meal. I look forward to going back to Lindys in Columbus again but the Lake House, probably not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 2019-11-16 14:37:10\\\\\n",

The pizza and dessert were amazing. My only complaint is that the chairs were uncomfortable, I think they could add some more comfortable seating to give this more of a \"wine bar\" feel.

Bartenders are always great.   If it is on the menu... Try it.   Only the Navajo tacos have been so so.  Everything else is outstanding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2013-12-07 01:09:23 |\n",

And one guy that was cutting up something was eating. They need to wash their hands after scratching. Will not be back to this one                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 2018-05-02 18:55:11 |\n",

The inside looks like a fire hall set up for a wedding.   It is so loud that I sometimes can't hear my dinner partner across the table.  But none of that matters when you taste the food.  The pasta is outstanding, and served in enormous, enormous portions.  The menu is a bit cryptic - dishes aren't really described, only named, so make sure you know what you're getting before you order.  \n",

The pretezel bites were awesome, hot and soft. The seafood salad was fair. The use imitation crab meat in a creamy base, similar to Neptune salad. My husband enjoyed his pizza, but Angelos in Lakewood is still his favorite. The lady at the counter who took our order was very friendly and helpful. She explained the specials and talked to my husband about their Cruisin' nights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2017-09-08 23:39:53 |\n",

The chicken pastina was served hot and serving size was big, enough for 2 meals. The lasagne was a large portion and perfect temperature!! The atmosphere was not your every day restaurant, when we walked in there was fresh baked bread cooling on the tables! It was delicious!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 2013-08-03 17:47:13 |\n",

Honesty, it had about three table spoons of tuna with TWO HUGE pieces of focaccia bread and a hint of vinegar!  THAT is not a tuna sandwich.  THAT is  focaccia bread with a hint of tuna!  Pizza was really good!  Fountain drinks we're $3.00!   Never again will I eat here for the money they charge and the conservative portions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2018-06-25 02:39:57 |\n",

One nice perk is that they have an open table that you can stand at to enjoy your pre-dinner drinks so you don't have to crowd around those sitting at the bar. I absolutely love the atmosphere at this place with the big wood-burning pizza oven behind the bar where you can watch your pizza being cooked. They have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big. When I went a couple months ago, they had caramelized brussel sprouts that they cooked in the wood-burning oven that were amazing!! I've tried many of their pizzas and haven't had one that I dislike. My favorites are the Quattro Formaggio and the Spicy Sopressata, which despite the name, is not too spicy. In the summer, a huge perk to this place is their outdoor patio. They have a couple long picnic tables and also have smaller tables along the fence. On a warm spring/summer night, it's very relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2014-01-17 16:49:06 |\n",

What a great choice we made.  Sat at the bar up front and enjoyed the interaction with both the bartenders and cooks who prepare the food right in front of you.  Had the grilled oysters as appitizer (awesome must have) along with the halibut special which was off the charts. We will be back again for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2014-08-11 02:06:40 |\n",

The entrance was a little confusing, but we quickly realized that we were walking through the brewery which was super cool. Our waitress was super friendly. I got the chipotle bbq chicken sandwich and the bbq pork sandwich. Both were delicious and good sized portions for the price and those fries! The menu said they were homemade beer battered fries and they were amazing! I also got one of their house brewed beers on tap which was also good and the pricing is more than reasonable on a pint! I was extremely pleased with our entire experience and we will be going back often!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 2015-03-04 20:18:07 |\n",

I was visiting extended family and we bought two pizzas--1/2 veggie/meat and one cheese. The sauce was too sweet and the veggies were not at all what I expected. Now, Mineo's...better pizza.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2009-03-01 03:53:38 |\n",

Didnt like that pop comes in a plastice bottle $2.99 each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 2015-06-21 01:16:36 |\n",

Thie slices were reheated and not as fresh as I had hoped. If you come here, then I highly recommend ordering something that is made on to order such as a whole pie or a hoagie.\n",

       "The prices seemed reasonable though I wasn't exactly sure of the portions. I small pie is $5.99, a medium pie is $7.99, and a large pie is $9.99 though I have no clue what the diameter of any of those pies are. There are also about a dozen hoagies on the menu (including a gyro) for about $6. They also have burgers for $2.49!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2013-12-07 01:19:24 |\n",

Work on your customer service and don't offer things that you're not willing to provide                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2016-01-04 07:33:29 |\n",

       "Yummy with lots of lobster.   Finished with grilled pub sprouts.   They were very filling.   Tasty with bacon like meat.   Very nice.   Had 8 in our group, waited 5 or 10 minutes, quick service, sat us right away, waiter was great.    Would highly recommend and will definitely be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2017-01-02 07:08:45 |\n",

A BYOB restaurant tucked away on the working class side of Mt Washington serving delicious homemade Italian classics. Brought my family here when they were in town to visit and everyone came away satisfied. I wish my girlfriend still lived down the street from this place because we don't get there as often as we should.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 2015-06-08 18:51:54 |\n",

I didn't have a lot of options but the front desk suggested this place. I got the shrimp sandwich &amp; jalapeño poppers for delivery. The food took a while &amp; when I called the restaurant, the workers sounded baffled bc my order had been lost. It wasn't until the manager (Matt, I believe) came on the line to help me out. I guess the driver had gotten lost &amp; went to the wrong hotel. In the middle of my meal, I realized I didn't get a receipt so I called back &amp; the manager was willing to drop it off on his way home. I thought that was really sweet but I insisted he drop it off tomorrow. I still woke up to my receipt &amp; I must say, I was really impressed by him. The fact that I'm from out of town clearly means I won't be a regular here, so he didn't have to go out of his way. It was unfortunate my food was late but unlike the servers who answered the phone &amp; casually just said my order wasn't placed, then handed the phone to the manager because they didn't want to deal with me, the manager going out of his way to make sure I was happy really stood out to me. Also, the food really IS delicious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2014-10-27 12:17:36 |\n",

       "Let me start by saying we came in during the dinner rush on a Saturday and were able to immediately sit at the bar area. While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. \n",

       "As far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service.\n",

       "My dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. \n",

       "We ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.  The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin. The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. \n",

Chicken was good but they forgot to include the Marsala sauce. You have to make sure there is enough sauce to go on the pasta. Pasta was so dry it was hard to eat. You need to make this meal a lot better. Other than that the service was very good and wait staff very friendly. Have had other meals which were good but this was really not up to par.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2019-12-07 15:04:13 |\n",

It was very good but a little small. What I don't understand is why a small lasagna cost $19. I found that to be an outrageous price. I only ordered it because it was different. I could have easily been priced at $10 or even less. Tomatoes and even vegan cheese are not that expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 2019-11-19 07:24:12 |\n",

Such an interesting menu, great presentation, and high quality eats. I would recommend coming early, as the crowd piles in quick. My only real complaint is that they open pretty late for the breakfast crowd. But if you are a noon-riser, bougee bruncher, this is your place!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2019-12-05 22:59:39 |\n",

There were 8 of us so we got to try everything. 95% of what we tried was very good, 5% not at all. Everything there is made from scratch, you can see the kitchen out in the open and you can taste that in the quality of the food. Crispy Brussels Sprouts - good, Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Carpaccio - excellent, Grilled Peach and Mascarpone Dip - the only hiccup of the night, not good at all, Sweet Corn and White Bean Chowder Soup - good. For main courses: 4 cheese bianco - I am not a good judge of pizza as I don't eat it but my niece said it was good, my son had a burger - he said it was excellent, very big portion, fried chicken - this portion is absolutely huge and my brother devoured it, he said it was excellent (I didn't try it personally), barramundi (from their specials menu) - very good, walleye - excellent, grilled prime sirloin - excellent, definitely a great value at $23. For dessert - their house made donuts holes and flourless chocolate torte - both excellent. At the end of the night, the owner (Israel) stopped by our table, asked us for the feedback, when we mentioned our experience with the dip (see above), they promptly removed it from the bill. Our server (and I apologize I don't remember the name) - was excellent, very friendly and attentive. So why 4 stars and not 5? The noise level was very loud (we came on Friday night), at some points we didn't hear each other and since restaurant was very busy our server was trying to be in too many places at the same time. But, great experience overall, great value for the money and my daughter even mentioned that she will consider this restaurant for her birthday with her friends (they have semi-private room in the back that wouldn't be as loud so could work out perfectly) | 2019-12-07 19:57:20 |\n",

Get just a couple toppings, and kids love it!  I live close and my pizza, when delivered, is always good. Take advantage of the coupons. Also the crust is chewy and delicious. The breadsticks are awful though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 2016-03-25 04:30:39 |\n",

The restaurant has arm resting chairs for the majority of their customers and chandeliers across the restaurant. They have a piano player during the weekends which adds an extra touch of elegance. \n",

       "Honestly, this is my new favorite brunch spot. The have plenty of food choices and the service is great. I ordered the salmon omelet which was cooked to perfection. I had a side of berries with it and sipped on a cup of coffee.

The pizza is great but the service is even better. They have lots of options and toppings but the two young ladies at the front, Andrea and Angelica, were extremely friendly and also very helpful. S/o to those two, I will definitely be returning!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2018-06-29 03:06:51 |\n",

Some of the servers there are just not super personable (although some are fantastic). The bartenders tend to be slow. The hosts are usually just kind of meh. But we love the food so much! And the hot olive Bloody Mary is five stars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2019-09-13 17:23:46 |\n",

We called back the store and the dude came back. He told me and my brother ( me being 14 and him being 12) that we miscounted it and that he was really good at math we couldn't be wrong but he said if he has extra money at the end of his shift he would drop it off to us. I thought that was weird and told my mom who like a mom does freaked out that her money was basically stolen. Note we're broke broke. So she calls corporate just in case I have no clue what she said to them. After that we got our money back and everything was fine and dandy just a simple screw up. \n",

My husband has a shellfish allergy which is pretty common.  We have never been to a halfway decent restaurant that was unable to accommodate this.  The kitchen was actually rude about it!  We will never go there again. They were unable to give us selections that he actually could eat...  Pretty pathetic. On top of that the scallops that I ordered were rubbery and my daughters mussels were fishy and the shells were falling apart. WORST SEAFOOD RESTAURANT WE HAVE EVER BEEN TO!

Meanwhile I look around and there are less than 10 patrons in the restaurant that seats close to 100 for dining. So I walk away and go somewhere else. I am shocked that a place that cooks pasta...5-7 mins per grocery box directions with maybe a pre made sauce and grilled protein can't seat single diner with 60mins left before closing....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2019-09-16 00:33:03 |\n",

I like that it's easy to customize with what you want on your pizza but sometimes it can be a little overwhelming--that's why we like to order what's on the menu board and then add a few of the things we like most. \n",

I went there because I have allergies and it  was close by.  After waiting for several minutes for someone to help me, I asked if I could get a gluten-free cheese steak hoagie with the vegan cheese. He said no, they only have a gluten free menu or a allergen free menu. I said ok, and ordered something very quickly from the allergen free page because I could tell he was annoyed and stressed out. So then I order a normal pizza for my daughter, he tells me the total, and I pull out a credit card. He says we don't accept credit cards, I said oh ok. Eh I don't think I have cash on me as I search my wallet. I only had four dollars so I said. Oh I guess we'll have to go somewhere else. He FLIPS on me, tells me that I'M RUDE and continues to yell obscenities at me and my little daughter. My daughter starts crying, and I tell the guy to shut up and he seriously YELLED At me saying \"OH wow, what a great mom you are.\" And I said \"Thank you, I AM a great mom.\" left. Never in my life has any business owner been like that. Especially one who claims to care about allergies. So I tell my brother who used to order form there frequently (we were visiting him) and he said they don't order from there anymore because its gone downhill and they've screwed up my SIL's order so many times. It may have been good at one time but I neither me or my family will ever support them again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 2019-11-14 19:10:18 |\n",

The food is nearly always excellent, but the service is uneven.  We went in for Sunday brunch and found the restaurant maybe half-full.  We stood at the podium and waited for the hostess to seat us.... and waited..... and waited....   it was a good ten minutes before the hostess appeared (with no apology) and seated us in back when there were plenty of tables by a window--not a big deal though.    And we waited.... and waited....  after fifteen minutes of being ignored by several servers going to other tables, my wife got up and reminded the hostess of our existence and that we had not seen a server at our table.  Another five to seven minutes of waiting and we got up and left.  On our way out, we mentioned that we were leaving to a server who acted like we had told an extremely funny joke.  Never again, La Brioche.  You have lost our business forever!\n",
       "  BTW, we went to Cafe Hollander in Hilldale where we were seated and waited upon immediately.  The food was outstanding too.  I strongly recommend Cafe Hollander over La Brioche!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2017-06-13 02:14:53 |\n",

Unfortunately I was disappointed. Our waitress seemed disconnected, was not friendly and seemed like she didn't want to be there, so that was not a good start. We started with the lump crab appetizer which was good. They don't give you enough tortillas to dip, so I asked for a couple more and saw a charge on my bill for that. The place is loud, so be prepared. I had the shrimp and lobster fettuccine which was ok, a little bland, and the Lake House salad, which was good, original. Unfortunately I didn't see anything interesting on the cocktail menu so I had water. My bill for the 3 items came to $48, which I thought was a bit high for what I got. There are other places I would rather go if I'm going to spend $50 for a meal. I look forward to going back to Lindys in Columbus again but the Lake House, probably not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2019-11-16 14:37:10 |\n",

       "1     Parking is tough to get here so I don't get to go much. I also get a little cautious sometimes as they frequently have multiple questionable looking characters.\\n\\nPro's:\\n- Legendary fries that used to be super huge and gave you great value for your buck\\n- Good burgers\\n- If you drink, it looks like they have a lot of different kinds of alcohol\\n\\nCon's:\\n- Customer Service? Hahaha. Not here. If you can get more than a fart out of one of the twin's working there, you are ahead of the pack.\\n- Dirty, messy tables, crap everywhere.\\n- Many questionable characters here. Someone once asked me if I wanted to buy stolen jewelry off them while I was eating. I'm being totally honest too.\\n- Their french fry portions have gotten smaller. They used to need two baskets for a large fry and now only need one.\\n- Really expensive hot dogs. \\n- They have strict limits on ketchup. No I'm not joking. 2 for large fries, 1 for anything less.\\n\\nI do recommend getting their legendary fries at least once and I do recommend the egg burger, but get it to go and go when it is light out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "2     The server had an extensive knowledge of wines & their various menu selections and it was clear that we were her top priority. The pizza and dessert were amazing. My only complaint is that the chairs were uncomfortable, I think they could add some more comfortable seating to give this more of a \"wine bar\" feel. Otherwise everything was amazing!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "8     It's on Mt. Washington, but no view.  The inside looks like a fire hall set up for a wedding.   It is so loud that I sometimes can't hear my dinner partner across the table.  But none of that matters when you taste the food.  The pasta is outstanding, and served in enormous, enormous portions.  The menu is a bit cryptic - dishes aren't really described, only named, so make sure you know what you're getting before you order.  \\n\\nAnd it's BYOB, so don't forget your wine!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "9     There is a large dine-in area that is child friendly with arcade games. The pretezel bites were awesome, hot and soft. The seafood salad was fair. The use imitation crab meat in a creamy base, similar to Neptune salad. My husband enjoyed his pizza, but Angelos in Lakewood is still his favorite. The lady at the counter who took our order was very friendly and helpful.

       "12    Oh my gosh!  Italian tuna sandwich?  Honesty, it had about three table spoons of tuna with TWO HUGE pieces of focaccia bread and a hint of vinegar!  THAT is not a tuna sandwich.  THAT is  focaccia bread with a hint of tuna!  Pizza was really good!  Fountain drinks we're $3.00!   Never again will I eat here for the money they charge and the conservative portions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "13    Having just moved to the area, Casey's has been such an amazing place to have available.  They truly have a little bit of everything available 24 hours a day.  Everybody who works here has always been so friendly and helpful. Their pizza is also really, really, really good.  It's my favorite so far in the area.  Who would've thought???  We have only done carry out up to this point, but they do now offer delivery.  Delivery hours are 4:30 p.m. - 10 p.m. There is a delivery fee of $2 per order with a minimum purchase of $10 required. Forms of payment accepted include major credit cards, cash and check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "14    The food and vibe here is outstanding. It's definitely a place where I'll be taking all our friends when they come into Madison.\\n\\nFor starters, the fried chicken is some of the best I've ever had. If you like buffalo sauce, it's a home run. \\n\\nMeatballs - pretty tasty themselves, but the red sauce is magical. \\n\\nEntrees:\\n\\nThe pizza sauce is perfect. While I love a good wood fired pizza, the steel pan pizza is Madison's pizza. I mean spotted cow in the dough? It's a thicker pizza with a cheese baked onto the outside of the dough. \\n\\nThe black mushroom truffle wood fired and Calabrian sausage pizza were the two our table tried.\\n\\nDessert:\\nThe only dessert currently in the place is the pizza cookie, but it's all it needs. A partially baked cookie covered with vanilla ice cream. Drool... The entire table can share it and it's a whopping $5. Get 1 per 4 people and you're set.\\n\\nThere's a lounge downstairs, amazing beer selection, and much more I could talk about. Check it out. You won't be upset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "15    If you come on a Friday or Saturday after 6 or 7pm, expect to have a bit of a wait. One nice perk is that they have an open table that you can stand at to enjoy your pre-dinner drinks so you don't have to crowd around those sitting at the bar. I absolutely love the atmosphere at this place with the big wood-burning pizza oven behind the bar where you can watch your pizza being cooked. They have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big. When I went a couple months ago, they had caramelized brussel sprouts that they cooked in the wood-burning oven that were amazing!! I've tried many of their pizzas and haven't had one that I dislike. My favorites are the Quattro Formaggio and the Spicy Sopressata, which despite the name, is not too spicy. In the summer, a huge perk to this place is their outdoor patio. They have a couple long picnic tables and also have smaller tables along the fence. On a warm spring/summer night, it's very relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "16    Found good reviews on Yelp and decided to stop in prior to a concert at Blossom.  What a great choice we made.  Sat at the bar up front and enjoyed the interaction with both the bartenders and cooks who prepare the food right in front of you.  Had the grilled oysters as appitizer (awesome must have) along with the halibut special which was off the charts. We will be back again for sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "18    Just stopped here for a quick lunch. The entrance was a little confusing, but we quickly realized that we were walking through the brewery which was super cool. Our waitress was super friendly. I got the chipotle bbq chicken sandwich and the bbq pork sandwich. Both were delicious and good sized portions for the price and those fries! The menu said they were homemade beer battered fries and they were amazing! I also got one of their house brewed beers on tap which was also good and the pricing is more than reasonable on a pint! I was extremely pleased with our entire experience and we will be going back often!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "19    Honestly? It tasted weird. I was visiting extended family and we bought two pizzas--1/2 veggie/meat and one cheese.

We left happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "22    This place is the epitome of a mom and pop's corner pizzeria. There is only one table with four chairs (it's designed to be a takeout shop - not quite a dine in), you can see the entire kitchen, and they sell some convenience items such as milk, eggs, and cereal.\\n\\nI decided to order two of the $1.50 slices which were advertised in front of the shop. I would describe these slices as eighths of a circular sicilian pie. Thie slices were reheated and not as fresh as I had hoped. If you come here, then I highly recommend ordering something that is made on to order such as a whole pie or a hoagie.\\n\\nThe prices seemed reasonable though I wasn't exactly sure of the portions. I small pie is $5.99, a medium pie is $7.99, and a large pie is $9.99 though I have no clue what the diameter of any of those pies are. There are also about a dozen hoagies on the menu (including a gyro) for about $6. They also have burgers for $2.49!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "24    With all the talk of Rocky's, Toppers and Ian's, this place has in my opinion the best pizza... I've not tried their regular pizza, but their Chicago stuffed style is the best I've had in Madison.\\n\\nAnd their sandwiches are very good as well. They have a fantastic selection for a pizza delivery place, and they deliver quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "25    Would not take my Entertainment Book coupons off of my phone, although they obviously signed up for that option since it was offered. Wasn't very pleasant when not letting me use it either. Work on your customer service and don't offer things that you're not willing to provide                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "27    One of the best Italian restaurants in a city that has several. A BYOB restaurant tucked away on the working class side of Mt Washington serving delicious homemade Italian classics. Brought my family here when they were in town to visit and everyone came away satisfied. I wish my girlfriend still lived down the street from this place because we don't get there as often as we should.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "28    Visiting from CA & arrived at the hotel on a sunday night (yesterday). I didn't have a lot of options but the front desk suggested this place. I got the shrimp sandwich & jalapeño poppers for delivery. The food took a while & when I called the restaurant, the workers sounded baffled bc my order had been lost. It wasn't until the manager (Matt, I believe) came on the line to help me out. I guess the driver had gotten lost & went to the wrong hotel. In the middle of my meal, I realized I didn't get a receipt so I called back & the manager was willing to drop it off on his way home. I thought that was really sweet but I insisted he drop it off tomorrow. I still woke up to my receipt & I must say, I was really impressed by him. The fact that I'm from out of town clearly means I won't be a regular here, so he didn't have to go out of his way. It was unfortunate my food was late but unlike the servers who answered the phone & casually just said my order wasn't placed, then handed the phone to the manager because they didn't want to deal with me, the manager going out of his way to make sure I was happy really stood out to me. Also, the food really IS delicious.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "29    Horrible Food don't waste your money\\n\\nThis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.\\n\\nLoudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. Not one person there had decent customer service skills I had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and I have excellent hearing. I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. \\n\\nI looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "30    Where Humble may have fallen short for other Yelpers in the past, it surpassed expectations for my family and I this past Saturday. \\n\\nLet me start by saying we came in during the dinner rush on a Saturday and were able to immediately sit at the bar area. While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. \\n\\nAs far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service.\\n\\nMy dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. \\n\\nWe ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.  The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin. The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. \\n\\nSomething tells me I'm going to have a hard time convincing my family to try any other restaurants next time we have plans to eat out in Lakewood.\n",

       "67140 Had dinner last night. Ordered the chicken Marsala. Meal came with angel hair pasta. Chicken was good but they forgot to include the Marsala sauce. You have to make sure there is enough sauce to go on the pasta. Pasta was so dry it was hard to eat. You need to make this meal a lot better. Other than that the service was very good and wait staff very friendly. Have had other meals which were good but this was really not up to par.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "67141 I went here for the first time Monday night. I ordered the special vegan lasagna. It was very good but a little small. What I don't understand is why a small lasagna cost $19. I found that to be an outrageous price. I only ordered it because it was different. I could have easily been priced at $10 or even less. Tomatoes and even vegan cheese are not that expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "67143 With kind & courteous customer service, hand carved & ground meats, and an amazing ranch dressing Falorio's is a much needed change of place from some of the other local shops. I highly suggest a steak salad or the Sicilian pizza. This shop pays homage to many of the Pittsburgh staples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "67144 I have lived in Tremont for 4 years and FINALLY got around to checking this place out. Such an interesting menu, great presentation, and high quality eats. I would recommend coming early, as the crowd piles in quick. My only real complaint is that they open pretty late for the breakfast crowd. But if you are a noon-riser, bougee bruncher, this is your place!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "67145 My parents suggested we go there for my brother's birthday. There were 8 of us so we got to try everything. 95% of what we tried was very good, 5% not at all. Everything there is made from scratch, you can see the kitchen out in the open and you can taste that in the quality of the food. Crispy Brussels Sprouts - good, Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Carpaccio - excellent, Grilled Peach and Mascarpone Dip - the only hiccup of the night, not good at all, Sweet Corn and White Bean Chowder Soup - good. For main courses: 4 cheese bianco - I am not a good judge of pizza as I don't eat it but my niece said it was good, my son had a burger - he said it was excellent, very big portion, fried chicken - this portion is absolutely huge and my brother devoured it, he said it was excellent (I didn't try it personally), barramundi (from their specials menu) - very good, walleye - excellent, grilled prime sirloin - excellent, definitely a great value at $23. For dessert - their house made donuts holes and flourless chocolate torte - both excellent. At the end of the night, the owner (Israel) stopped by our table, asked us for the feedback, when we mentioned our experience with the dip (see above), they promptly removed it from the bill. Our server (and I apologize I don't remember the name) - was excellent, very friendly and attentive. So why 4 stars and not 5? The noise level was very loud (we came on Friday night), at some points we didn't hear each other and since restaurant was very busy our server was trying to be in too many places at the same time. But, great experience overall, great value for the money and my daughter even mentioned that she will consider this restaurant for her birthday with her friends (they have semi-private room in the back that wouldn't be as loud so could work out perfectly)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "67146 This is a review for pizza carry out or eaten in dream lanes. The pizza is very good!  Get just a couple toppings, and kids love it!  I live close and my pizza, when delivered, is always good. Take advantage of the coupons. Also the crust is chewy and delicious. The breadsticks are awful though.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "67147 La Brioche is such a fun, hidden gem. It has a very elegant vibe with affordable prices. The restaurant has arm resting chairs for the majority of their customers and chandeliers across the restaurant. They have a piano player during the weekends which adds an extra touch of elegance. \\n\\nHonestly, this is my new favorite brunch spot. The have plenty of food choices and the service is great. I ordered the salmon omelet which was cooked to perfection. I had a side of berries with it and sipped on a cup of coffee. Perfect brunch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "67148 Unfortunately this is the worst pizza I have had in Pittsburgh. The crust was good but the toppings tasted like there were frozen and not fresh.

       "67149 Decided to finally use a pizza coupon I got over a year ago and am wishing I would've used it earlier. The pizza is great but the service is even better. They have lots of options and toppings but the two young ladies at the front, Andrea and Angelica, were extremely friendly and also very helpful. S/o to those two, I will definitely be returning!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "67150 We really love Dante Next Door and it's probably my husband and my favorite Tremont brunch spot, but I can't bring myself to give it five stars because the service is always unpredictable. Some of the servers there are just not super personable (although some are fantastic). The bartenders tend to be slow. The hosts are usually just kind of meh. But we love the food so much! And the hot olive Bloody Mary is five stars.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "67151 Aight I used to love this place. We always ordered\\n here because my family is mad broke and we need\\n to eat. One day my mom says she only has 100 dollars in her room and so if we need to get pizza we need to get change so we're like okay we'll let the delivery dude know. \\n\\nI put my order in online and specifically say bring change for a 100. They bring extra change and it seems all good. While the delivery dude was counting it outside though it seemed like he counted it wrong. So when I went in and counted the money I found that we were given less than what we needed back. We called back the store and the dude came back. He told me and my brother ( me being 14 and him being 12) that we miscounted it and that he was really good at math we couldn't be wrong but he said if he has extra money at the end of his shift he would drop it off to us. I thought that was weird and told my mom who like a mom does freaked out that her money was basically stolen. Note we're broke broke. So she calls corporate just in case I have no clue what she said to them. After that we got our money back and everything was fine and dandy just a simple screw up. \\n\\nA few months after that In August (this all happened In June) I call to order. They tell me that we are banned from delivery because of something that wasn't even our fault STILL NOTE my brother and I are minors. We shouldn't be getting reprimanded for a mess up on the delivery persons end that he fixed!! \\n\\nAll in all this used to be my favorite pizza place and now I have to settle with dominoes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "67152 You know exactly what you're in for when you get the food: greasy, bowling alley indulgences. It's literally out of a bowling alley. It's delicious, if that's what you're looking for.\\n\\nBut the service. I can't stress how poor the service is. They've signed up for EatStreet, but they haven't implemented it properly. Apartment numbers seem to get lost, even though it'll show up clear as day on the EatStreet receipt. Now, if you think the long-suffering delivery driver is trying to play you, take a look at the boxes: no full address on the sticker. None.\\n\\nI feel for them, and decided to call in and see what's up. Rude guy on the phone, not too wild about grabbing a manager. He eventually tried to call a manager (since this was a process failure), and the manager decided they had something better to do with their time.\\n\\n\"Look, what went wrong,\" I asked, my blood sugar officially crashed. \"What can we, the customer, do to fit your process?\"\\n\\nWrong question.\\n\\nI got my late food. It was cold. I let them know it was cold. Well, too bad for me! Should've called or sent a carrier pigeon if I wanted hot food.\\n\\nTheir only saving grace are the drivers, who are trying their best. But this place is garbage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "67153 Tried Danny Boy's for pizza week, and I have to admit that I was very pleasantly surprised with their menu. It was a lot more eclectic than most pizza places I know.\\n\\nThe brussel sprouts were AMAZING, and the pizza was delicious.\\n\\nThe waitstaff was friendly, and the atmosphere was upbeat and fun, so while we ate, the kids made friends with people at the surrounding tables and the staff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "67154 We went to this restaurant for the first time tonight. My husband has a shellfish allergy which is pretty common.  We have never been to a halfway decent restaurant that was unable to accommodate this.  The kitchen was actually rude about it!  We will never go there again. They were unable to give us selections that he actually could eat...  Pretty pathetic. On top of that the scallops that I ordered were rubbery and my daughters mussels were fishy and the shells were falling apart. WORST SEAFOOD RESTAURANT WE HAVE EVER BEEN TO!  NEVER AGAIN!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "67155 I can't even check in because during my time here in Lyndhurst, twice I have gone in around 8pm.and both times the hostess has denied me trying to eat there with her piss poor attitude about how they close at 9pm and they have been slammed all day and she not sure if she can seat me. Meanwhile I look around and there are less than 10 patrons in the restaurant that seats close to 100 for dining. So I walk away and go somewhere else. I am shocked that a place that cooks pasta...5-7 mins per grocery box directions with maybe a pre made sauce and grilled protein can't seat single diner with 60mins left before closing....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "67158 Amazing selection of toppings. Kinda like subway but pizza. I love building my own pizza and the salads are outrageously good. I usually order the margherita and then load it with veggies and cheeses. I actually prefer it cold because the crust tends to get a little soggy from all the toppings. \\nIve told everyone I know to try this place. Its worth the $8.45 for an 11 inch loaded pie. Half the price of most pizza joints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "67159 Came in on a busy Friday evening and ordered two pizzas. I like that it's easy to customize with what you want on your pizza but sometimes it can be a little overwhelming--that's why we like to order what's on the menu board and then add a few of the things we like most. \\n\\nPizza was freshly prepared and quite tasty. Beware that the spicy red sauce may be a little too spicy for some people (myself included)...\\n\\nOnly reason this wasn't a 5 star experience was our cashier was rude and dismissive while we asked a clarifying question at checkout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "67162 The worst customer service I have ever experienced. The owner needs a Xanax or something. I went there because I have allergies and it  was close by.  After waiting for several minutes for someone to help me, I asked if I could get a gluten-free cheese steak hoagie with the vegan cheese. He said no, they only have a gluten free menu or a allergen free menu. I said ok, and ordered something very quickly from the allergen free page because I could tell he was annoyed and stressed out. So then I order a normal pizza for my daughter, he tells me the total, and I pull out a credit card. He says we don't accept credit cards, I said oh ok. Eh I don't think I have cash on me as I search my wallet. I only had four dollars so I said. Oh I guess we'll have to go somewhere else. He FLIPS on me, tells me that I'M RUDE and continues to yell obscenities at me and my little daughter. My daughter starts crying, and I tell the guy to shut up and he seriously YELLED At me saying \"OH wow, what a great mom you are.\" And I said \"Thank you, I AM a great mom.\" left. Never in my life has any business owner been like that. Especially one who claims to care about allergies. So I tell my brother who used to order form there frequently (we were visiting him) and he said they don't order from there anymore because its gone downhill and they've screwed up my SIL's order so many times. It may have been good at one time but I neither me or my family will ever support them again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "67163 I really enjoyed the food at BB Jacks. I ordered the veggie wrap with a side of sweet potato fries. Absolutely delicious.

       "67165 I'm originally from the other side of Ohio and I've always really enjoyed jets pizza. However, the people that run the store just absolutely don't know what they're doing. Orders are wrong so often and today they never called my name for my order and it sat in the heater for 20 minutes. I was staring at a pizza box wondering if it was mine but thought \"surely they would call my name if it was my order, right?\"\\n\\nI received my order then an hour after I placed it due to pure incompetence, wasting more of my night over pizza than I would like. I am done with this Jet's location FOREVER. Order we your own discretion-delicious if the store doesn't absolutely infuriated you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "67166 Yes, yes, YES!! We loved going to the place in Shadyside, and were ecstatic when we learned that they were opening this place up in Fox Chapel. My wife and I have been enjoying their pizza for quite some time, and this was a very welcome addition to our repertoire of pizza establishments we love.\\n\\nThe dough is super nice - has a little stretch to it, and definitely picks up all the yumminess of the wood fired oven. You really can't go wrong with any of their options - I love their Pizza della casa with arugula and Pizza del Re the most.\\n\\nIt's a little chaotic on weekends, but it's nice to see a new business bustling - I want them to succeed. I haven't tried their gelato yet but it looks amazing. Give them a try - you won't be sorry!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "67167 Went here for a lunch meeting amidst s typical suburban strip mall, and I was pleasantly surprised by the  decor as I walked in. \\n\\nWe sat at the bar and was greeted by the friendly bartender, who continuously attended to us in a non over  bearing way. \\n\\nFood is locally sourced and you can taste the quality in how it is prepared. \\n\\nMy turkey sandwich was freshly sliced turkey breast on a toasted artisanal bread, with hand cut fries.

       "67168 My wife and I have eaten at La Brioche at least a dozen times.  The food is nearly always excellent, but the service is uneven.  We went in for Sunday brunch and found the restaurant maybe half-full.  We stood at the podium and waited for the hostess to seat us.... and waited..... and waited....   it was a good ten minutes before the hostess appeared (with no apology) and seated us in back when there were plenty of tables by a window--not a big deal though.    And we waited.... and waited....  after fifteen minutes of being ignored by several servers going to other tables, my wife got up and reminded the hostess of our existence and that we had not seen a server at our table.  Another five to seven minutes of waiting and we got up and left.  On our way out, we mentioned that we were leaving to a server who acted like we had told an extremely funny joke.  Never again, La Brioche.  You have lost our business forever!\\n  BTW, we went to Cafe Hollander in Hilldale where we were seated and waited upon immediately.  The food was outstanding too.  I strongly recommend Cafe Hollander over La Brioche!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "67169 First let me say Lindys in Columbus is one of my favorite restaurants, so I was anxious to try the Lake House. Unfortunately I was disappointed. Our waitress seemed disconnected, was not friendly and seemed like she didn't want to be there, so that was not a good start. We started with the lump crab appetizer which was good. They don't give you enough tortillas to dip, so I asked for a couple more and saw a charge on my bill for that. The place is loud, so be prepared. I had the shrimp and lobster fettuccine which was ok, a little bland, and the Lake House salad, which was good, original. Unfortunately I didn't see anything interesting on the cocktail menu so I had water. My bill for the 3 items came to $48, which I thought was a bit high for what I got. There are other places I would rather go if I'm going to spend $50 for a meal. I look forward to going back to Lindys in Columbus again but the Lake House, probably not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
